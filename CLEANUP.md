# Cleanup Guide

## Resource Decommissioning
1. **Remove External Users**: When the collaboration ends or if a user no longer needs access, ensure to properly remove or disable their access.
2. **Delete Unused Resources**: Clean up any resources that are no longer needed to avoid unnecessary charges.

## Account Closure
1. **Review Subscriptions**: Make sure all subscriptions are either downgraded or cancelled if they are no longer needed.
2. **Audit Final State**: Perform a final audit to ensure no loose ends.
